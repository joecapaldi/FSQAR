If need prerequisites vcredist_x86 and vcredist_x64

####What is this?

The Flight Simulator Quick Access Recorder and Analyzer (FSQAR) is an add-on for Lockheed Martinâ€™s Prepar3D(R) simulation software. It is a standalone application which should be run together with the flight simulator. FSQAR is a powerful flight data recorder which can display 'live charts' of the simulator variables during flight. As well as I know, this software has no analogue in the flight simulator add-ons world. It allows observing at flight parameters in real time. The program is useful for simulator observation, flight analysis, aircraft model development, investigation of aerodynamics.

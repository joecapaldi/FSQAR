        The Flight Simulator Quick Access Recorder and Analyzer
    </h1>
    <p>
        This program is an add-on for the Lockheed Martin Prepar3D &reg; flight simulator. It records and analyze data from
        the simulator and may be used with any aircraft as third party developer add-ons as well as default aircrafts.
        This software has no analogue in the flight simulator add-ons world. It allows observing at flight parameters in
        real time. The analogue of the program in a real aircraft is called the Quick Access Recorder (QAR).
    </p>

    <p>
        To fly better and better from flight to flight you should use some analysis of your flight data.
        The program displays "live charts" the basic parameters of flight.
        This allows you to evaluate the quality of pilotage and the softness of landing.
        The most direct way to use this program is to determine the g-load at touchdown during landing.
        Other graphs allow you to see aerodynamics characteristics and deflection of control surfaces of the aircraft.
        In addition you can record the flight parameters to a file on disk for subsequent analysis in such program like Microsoft Excel.

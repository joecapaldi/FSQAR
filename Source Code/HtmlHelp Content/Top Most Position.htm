Top Most Position
</h1>It is assumed that you use the flight simulator in &#8220;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Window Mode</span>&#8221; not in &#8220;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Full Screen Mode</span>&#8221;. By default, the application window is &#8220;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Top Most</span>&#8221;
(i.e. the window is places at the top of the Z order). The window at
the top of the Z-order overlaps all other windows. However, the size of
the FSQAR window is less than the simulator window. Therefore, you can
see the simulator window as well as the FSQAR window. If you want, you
can turn off &#8220;Top Most&#8221; mode by using &#8220;Option Dialog&#8221;.

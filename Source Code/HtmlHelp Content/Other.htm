<h1>Other Software</h1>
My other work which can attract your attention is <a href="https://www.avsimrus.com/f/fsx-gauges-82/aerolog-the-flight-parameters-recorder-48799.html">AEROLOG</a> <https:>
the gauge for Microsoft Flight Simulator X and Flight Simulator 2004.
This gauge displays and write into file a lot of flight parameters.
Writing frequency can be arbitrarily assigned. Flight data can be
analyzed in a spreadsheet application or can be viewed with help of
data-plots. It works both in FSX and FS2004. Full set of variables are
displayed in the presence of FSIUPC not even registered. However, the
gauge can work without FSUIPC. This program is freeware. Source code of
the gauge may be interested for developers. Especially it is
interesting to look at functions for access to AIR-file. Some examples
of data plotting and flight analyze are given.<br><br>Another my work named: <a href="http://www.fsdeveloper.com/forum/resources/how-to-correctly-use-simconnect-in-standalone-application.24/">How to correctly use SimConnect in standalone application</a><http:>.
This is an article and a demonstration program for programmers. This
article describes the correct way to create a Windows application that
uses SimConnect functions as C++ classes. "The correct way" involves
the creation of a multi-threaded application with the exchange events
between the main and working threads and encapsulation of the client
thread, functions and structures of the SimConnect library in C++
classes. Paying attention to points of principle, the process of
creation client application is described.

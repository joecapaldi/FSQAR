For whom this was made?
</h1>The program was made for users who want to improve flight
techniques in the flight simulator and to know more about aerodynamics
and about principles of aircrafts' flight. FSQAR is a powerful flight
data recorder which can display 'live charts' of the simulator
variables during flight. As well as I know, this software has no
analogue in the flight simulator add-ons world. It allows observing at
flight parameters in real time. The most direct way to use this program
is to determine the g-load at touchdown during landing. Other graphs
allow you to see aerodynamics characteristics and deflection of control
surfaces of the aircraft.

</h1>All options of the program are available thought &#8220;Option Dialog&#8221;.
By default, this program requests data from the simulator four times
per second when your aircraft below 100 feet, once per second when your
aircraft below 2000 feet and every four seconds when the aircraft is
above this altitude. This is called '<span style="font-weight: bold;">schedule</span>'. It is useful for analysis of glideslope approach and landing. However, you can set option '<span style="font-weight: bold;">use timer</span>' and write the data four times per second on any altitude.

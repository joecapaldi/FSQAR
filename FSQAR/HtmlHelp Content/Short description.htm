Short description
</h1>The user interface is very simple and intuitive. The program has
three tabbed window: the charts display, the numerical display and the
favorites list in which selected data are displayed. The first three
buttons on the program's toolbar that allow to control the flight
simulator. They are: start simulation, pause simulation and quit from
the program. Also, the toolbar provides quick access to the diagrams.
There are seven different kinds of the charts for seven selected flight
conditions. Moreover, you can select &#8220;Control Window&#8221; from the toolbar
or menu and drive your aircraft by mouse. Also you can save current
chart as a JPEG image from &#8220;Charts&#8221; menu. I think that anyone will
understand the interface of this program without any difficulty.<br><br><img style="width: 800px; height: 624px;" alt="Screenshot" src="Screen1.jpg">

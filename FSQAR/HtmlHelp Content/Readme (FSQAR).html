<h1>What is FSQAR?
</h1>
The Flight Simulator Quick Access Recorder and Analyzer
(FSQAR) is an add-on for Lockheed Martin's Prepar3D(R) simulation
software. It is a standalone application which should be run together
with the flight simulator. It retrieves a lot of the simulator
variables and displays these variables as charts and numerical values.
Moreover, FSQAR allow to write these variables into a disk file for
further analyze in spreadsheet program. The program is useful for
simulator observation, flight analysis, aircraft model development,
investigation of aerodynamics.<br>

<h1>
For whom this was made?</h1>
The program was made for users who want to improve flight
techniques in the flight simulator and to know more about aerodynamics
and about principles of aircrafts' flight. FSQAR is a powerful flight
data recorder which can display 'live charts' of the simulator
variables during flight. As well as I know, this software has no
analogue in the flight simulator add-ons world. It allows observing at
flight parameters in real time. The most direct way to use this program
is to determine the g-load at touchdown during landing. Other graphs
allow you to see aerodynamics characteristics and deflection of control
surfaces of the aircraft.<br>
<br>
<h1>How it works?</h1>
The Flight Simulator Quick Access Recorder
and Analyzer (FSQAR) work only together with Lockheed Martin's
Prepar3D(R) Flight Simulator. It works with the simulator by
client-server principle. FSQAR uses this simulator as server to request
flight datum. The Lockheed Martin's Prepar3D(R) Flight Simulator should
be started first and the FSQAR program should be launched after it. The
application cannot be operated when the simulator in not running. It is
assumed that you use the flight simulator in &#8220;Window Mode&#8221; not in &#8220;Full
Screen Mode&#8221;. It is desirable for you to have any spreadsheet programs
(it may be Microsoft Excel or <a href="http://listoffreeware.com/list-best-free-spreadsheet-software/">other</a>
<http:>) for the analysis of the
collected data and any plotting programs to display the charts when the
simulator is off-line (for example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnuplot">gnuplot</a>
<https:> is the best for this purpose).<br>
<br>

<h1>Short description
</h1>
The user interface is very simple and intuitive. The program has
three tabbed window: the charts display, the numerical display and the
favorites list in which selected data are displayed. The first three
buttons on the program's toolbar that allow to control the flight
simulator. They are: start simulation, pause simulation and quit from
the program. Also, the toolbar provides quick access to the diagrams.
There are seven different kinds of the charts for seven selected flight
conditions. Moreover, you can select &#8220;Control Window&#8221; from the toolbar
or menu and drive your aircraft by mouse. Also you can save current
chart as a JPEG image from &#8220;Charts&#8221; menu. I think that anyone will
understand the interface of this program without any difficulty.<br>

<h1>Options
</h1>
All options of the program are available thought &#8220;Option Dialog&#8221;.
By default, this program requests data from the simulator four times
per second when your aircraft below 100 feet, once per second when your
aircraft below 2000 feet and every four seconds when the aircraft is
above this altitude. This is called '<span style="font-weight: bold;">schedule</span>'.
It is useful for analysis of glideslope approach and landing. However,
you can set option '<span style="font-weight: bold;">use
timer</span>' and write the data four times per second on any
altitude.<br>
<br>
<h1>The charts which are displayed</h1>
<p>
The program allows to observe in real time the charts of basics aerodynamics characteristics.
Simultaneous only three values can be displayed. The values were selected for some flight maneuvers.
</p>
<p>
These are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>g-load (isolated chart);</li>
<li>
landing (g-load, vertical speed, angle of attack);</li>
<li>
aerodynamic angles (g-load, angle of attack, sideslip angle);</li>
<li>
pitch (elevator deflection, pitch, angle of attack);</li>
<li>
bank (aileron deflection, bank, sideslip angle);</li>
<li>
heading (rudder deflection, heading, sideslip angle);</li>
<li>thrust (thrust levers position, angle of attack, indicated airspeed).</li>
</ul>
<h1>Top Most Position
</h1>
It is assumed that you use the flight simulator in &#8220;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Window Mode</span>&#8221; not in &#8220;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Full Screen Mode</span>&#8221;.
By default, the application window is &#8220;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Top Most</span>&#8221;
(i.e. the window is places at the top of the Z order). The window at
the top of the Z-order overlaps all other windows. However, the size of
the FSQAR window is less than the simulator window. Therefore, you can
see the simulator window as well as the FSQAR window. If you want, you
can turn off &#8220;Top Most&#8221; mode by using &#8220;Option Dialog&#8221;.<br>
<br>
<h1>
Simulator Variables
</h1>
The Flight Simulator Quick Access Recorder and Analyzer (FSQAR)
can display a large number of simulator variables. Each of these
variables is given with short description and units name. More
information you can take from Lockheed Martin's &#8220;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Learning Center</span>&#8221;
document which is included the standard simulator installation.
Favorites List
You can add seven value to the favorite list. Click right mouse button
and select the items which you want to add to the list. The list will
be saved and used every session.
<h1>Where the files which the program writes are placed?
</h1>
These files are placed in your '<span style="font-weight: bold;">My
Documents</span>' folder in '<span style="font-weight: bold;">Prepar3D
v3 Files\QAR</span>' folder. In this folder subfolders will be
created which are named like <span style="font-weight: bold;">Feb_2016</span>,
<span style="font-weight: bold;">May_2016</span>
etc. In these subfolders files will be placed which are named like
this: '<span style="font-weight: bold;">day_(hour_minutes)
aircraft name</span>'. Where 'day', 'hour' and 'minutes' are the
time when the record was started. To save disk space these files are
compressed into form gz-archives and can be extracted by any software
supporting gz-archive file format. For example: <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-zip</a> or
<a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gzip.htm">Gzip
for Windows</a>, freeware utilities. The data files
have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV</a>
(comma separated values) format and these can
be opened in any program like Microsoft Excel. If you don't want to
write file on disk, you can turn off this feature by uncheck the
checkbox in &#8220;Option Dialog&#8221;.<br>

<h1>Other Software</h1>

My other work which can attract your attention is <a href="https://www.avsimrus.com/f/fsx-gauges-82/aerolog-the-flight-parameters-recorder-48799.html">AEROLOG</a>
<https:>the gauge for Microsoft Flight Simulator X and Flight
Simulator 2004.
This gauge displays and write into file a lot of flight parameters.
Writing frequency can be arbitrarily assigned. Flight data can be
analyzed in a spreadsheet application or can be viewed with help of
data-plots. It works both in FSX and FS2004. Full set of variables are
displayed in the presence of FSIUPC not even registered. However, the
gauge can work without FSUIPC. This program is freeware. Source code of
the gauge may be interested for developers. Especially it is
interesting to look at functions for access to AIR-file. Some examples
of data plotting and flight analyze are given.<br>
<br>
Another my work named: <a href="http://www.fsdeveloper.com/forum/resources/how-to-correctly-use-simconnect-in-standalone-application.24/">How
to correctly use SimConnect in standalone application</a><http:>.
This is an article and a demonstration program for programmers. This
article describes the correct way to create a Windows application that
uses SimConnect functions as C++ classes. "The correct way" involves
the creation of a multi-threaded application with the exchange events
between the main and working threads and encapsulation of the client
thread, functions and structures of the SimConnect library in C++
classes. Paying attention to points of principle, the process of
creation client application is described.

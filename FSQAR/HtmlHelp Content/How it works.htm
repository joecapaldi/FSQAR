<body><h1>How it works?</h1>The Flight Simulator Quick Access Recorder
and Analyzer (FSQAR) work only together with Lockheed Martin's
Prepar3D(R) Flight Simulator. It works with the simulator by
client-server principle. FSQAR uses this simulator as server to request
flight datum. The Lockheed Martin's Prepar3D(R) Flight Simulator should
be started first and the FSQAR program should be launched after it. The
application cannot be operated when the simulator in not running. It is
assumed that you use the flight simulator in &#8220;Window Mode&#8221; not in &#8220;Full
Screen Mode&#8221;. It is desirable for you to have any spreadsheet programs
(it may be Microsoft Excel or <a href="http://listoffreeware.com/list-best-free-spreadsheet-software/">other</a> <http:>) for the analysis of the
collected data and any plotting programs to display the charts when the
simulator is off-line (for example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnuplot">gnuplot</a> <https:> is the best for this purpose).

<h1>Where the files which the program writes are placed?
</h1>
These files are placed in your '<span style="font-weight: bold;">My
Documents</span>' folder in '<span style="font-weight: bold;">Prepar3D
v3 Files\QAR</span>' folder. In this folder subfolders will be
created which are named like <span style="font-weight: bold;">Feb_2016</span>,
<span style="font-weight: bold;">May_2016</span>
etc. In these subfolders files will be placed which are named like
this: '<span style="font-weight: bold;">day_(hour_minutes)
aircraft name</span>'. Where 'day', 'hour' and 'minutes' are the
time when the record was started. To save disk space these files are
compressed into form gz-archives and can be extracted by any software
supporting gz-archive file format. For example: <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-zip</a> or
<a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gzip.htm">Gzip for Windows</a>, freeware utilities. The data files
have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV</a> (comma separated values) format and these can
be opened in any program like Microsoft Excel. If you don't want to
write file on disk, you can turn off this feature by uncheck the
checkbox in &#8220;Option Dialog&#8221;.<br><br><img style="width: 931px; height: 523px;" alt="Screenshot" src="screen2.jpg">
